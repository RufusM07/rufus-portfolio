        <p class="bio">
          Hi there! I am a detail-oriented and curious engineer who loves building things that make a real difference. Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers University specializing in Computer Engineering. Earlier, I earned my Bachelorâ€™s degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Karunya Institute of Technology and Sciences where my passion for automation and problem-solving really took off. In the past, I worked as a Programmer Analyst at Cognizant Technology Solutions, gaining hands-on experience with manual and automated software testing tools like Java, Selenium and TestNG contributing to system integrations & validation for enterprise platforms.
          I enjoy working across the full spectrum of technology that is from designing circuits & embedded systems to developing software and ensuring quality through S/W testing. More recently, Iâ€™ve been expanding my skills into Machine Learning and AI building intelligent models and systems that solve real world problems. Iâ€™m passionate about bridging hardware precision, software intelligence and AI innovation to create smarter, more reliable technologies. Iâ€™m always eager to learn, take on new challenges and collaborate on projects that make a lasting impact.
